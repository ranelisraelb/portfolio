            <p class="description">As much as I love writing up my own code, it's hard to beat the easy and stress free
                tools that CMS tools like Wix offers. The Filipino Community of Seattle is a non-profit cultural
                orginization dedicated to connecting Filipino people residing in Seattle.<br><br>While this website was
                pretty easy to put together, designing a website that was attractive, professional, and informational,
                but was still easy to navigate and felt familiar to a wide demographic in regards to age proved to be
                more difficult than I care to admit. Apart from that, my big focus here was mobile responsiveness, so
                designing around that in mind gave me good practice with the concept and I'm proud with what I managed
                to cook up.</p>
