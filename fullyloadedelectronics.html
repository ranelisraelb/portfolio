            <p class="headline">Something new.</p>
            <p class="description">Fully Loaded Electronics is a company dedicated to selling video game consoloes that
                are preloaded with games to public spaces like hospitals, universities and hotes.<br><br>My previous
                gigs
                were mainly focused around content creation but as time passed, I started to become interested more
                into seeing how many eyes were able to see that content and how did it affect the busines. I've only
                been working with Fully Loaded Electronics for a short period of time but so far I've gained experience
                with e-commerce platforms like Shopify, Google Adwords and Google Analytics. I've also been exposed to
                the
                business side of marketing, analyzing which channels have the biggest ROI or figuring out what are we
                spending resources on that isn't helping us grow.<br><br>As time goes on, I'll update this page with my
                experience but so far I've taken a deep interest in marketing and am eager to work in the
                field.</p>
